My name is Cameron Reaves, a junior at Harvard College studying Environmental Science and Public Policy. I am interested in the intersection of policy, technology and the environment, specifically through the lens of sustainable urban development. I am planning on writing a senior thesis on how transportation policy shaped social and environmental outcomes in Atlanta, GA.
